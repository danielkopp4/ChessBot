# Chess Bot

I left this repository here as archive but it does not achive as stable performance and is not as cleanly written as the AlphaZero implementation [linked here](https://github.com/danielkopp4/AlphaZeroChess) that I created. 

End to end deep learning model that can play chess

To play against the semi-pretrained models open the model_test notebook and dont train simply load weights and save the model as a full model. Then go to the play_chess notebook and specify the path to the full model and start playing.
